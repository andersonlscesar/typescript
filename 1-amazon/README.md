# Amazon Clone :computer:

Hi, I've been developing this project in order to practice more about Typescript. I really like the OOP paradigm, and I use it.
The most of JS programmers for some reason doesn't use OOP but the functional paradigm. 

This project consists basically of a zoom image Amazon's clone. 

## Technologies Behind it :pushpin:

* HTML5
* Typescript 
* CSS (Sass)

## Site structure
